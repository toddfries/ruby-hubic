- handle specifying container to all ops not just ls
- complete 'move'
- flesh 'containers'
- handle more errors and exceptions better
- finish the token refresh bits in lib/hubic/*.rb files
- when uploading files, where does the fugly
  #<Net::HTTPCreated 201 Created readbody=false>
  come from?  Can we hide it or make a better output?
- found in owncloud-files-hubic 'httpd/unix-directory', could be a dirtype to
  add

BUGS:
 - 'hubic ls -- -l dir/file' -> ''
